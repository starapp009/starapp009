- 👋 Hello, I'm @starapp009
- 👀 I am interested in technology and creativity
- 🌱 Currently I am studying to be a software engineer
- 💞️ I am looking to cooperate with companies specializing in software, engineering, and other fields that need development to contribute, change, improve, and constantly innovate according to trends. I only target where there are gaps in knowledge.
- 📫 How to contact me...:
Whenever I see a place with a lot of potholes, it's likely that I live nearby or have passed by it. :))</p>

<!---
This is a project to build a special, separate virtual machine.
Note: I'm a software engineer, so I can't collaborate on hardware.
Please contact me if you need me. Don't let your employees secretly study with me. Be careful, they will get punctured.</p>
